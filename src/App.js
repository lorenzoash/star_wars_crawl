                sinister FUNCTIONAL BUG has risen from the ashes of the CI Tool
                and will not rest until the last developer has been destroyed.

                brave RESISTANCE. He is desperate to find his Lead and gain her
                help in restoring peace and justice to the repository.

                mission to the production branch, where an old ally has
                discovered a clue to the Leadâ€™s whereabouts....
